# NASA image processing


Every image can be represented in two ways: a "bitmap," or a representation of what color each pixel is, and the associated Fourier spectrum. The Fourier spectrum is a representation of the "frequency space" of an image, where coarse details are represented by patterns in the low-frequency end of fourier space (visualized by being near to the center of the frequency plots) and fine details represented by areas in the high-frequency end of the Fourier spectrum. The original image has a periodic pattern which we wish to remove. In order to do this, we first pad the edges of the image with black. Next, we note the patterns in the Fouirer representation of the image and design a virtual filter to block out the high-frequency patterns, in this case a circle. Finally, we switch our representation back to the bitmap and display the image. This technique can be done with a computer, or directly in an imaging device, as the Fourier spectrum of the image always shows up in the back-focal-plane of the objective lens.
